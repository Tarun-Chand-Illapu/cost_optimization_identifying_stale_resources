The provided Python script is a AWS Lambda function written in Python using the Boto3 library to manage EBS (Elastic Block Store) snapshots. The purpose of this Lambda function is to clean up unused EBS snapshots. Here's an overview of the script:

  1. Import the Boto3 library, which provides a Python interface for AWS services.

  2. Define the lambda_handler function, which is the entry point for the Lambda function.

  3. Create an EC2 client using Boto3.

  4. Use describe_snapshots to retrieve information about all EBS snapshots owned by the AWS account (OwnerIds=['self']).

  5. Use describe_instances to get information about all running EC2 instances. Extract the instance IDs and store them in a set (active_instance_ids).

  6. Iterate through each EBS snapshot obtained from the describe_snapshots response.

  7. Check if the snapshot is attached to any volume (volume_id is present). If not, delete the snapshot and print a message.

  8. If the snapshot is attached to a volume, check if the volume still exists (describe_volumes). If the volume doesn't have any attachments (not attached to any running instance), delete the snapshot and print a message.

  9. Handle the case where the volume associated with the snapshot is not found (it might have been deleted). Delete the snapshot in this case and print a message.

This Lambda function is designed to clean up EBS snapshots that are not attached to any volume or are associated with a volume that is not attached to a running EC2 instance. It helps manage storage costs and ensures that only necessary EBS snapshots are retained. To use this Lambda function, you would typically set up a CloudWatch Events rule to trigger it periodically.
